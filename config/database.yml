# Install the MySQL driver

# Ensure the MySQL gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem "mysql2"

# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information
# like your database password in the repo. If your computer is ever compromised,
# a hacker would have access to the password for all the databases in the app.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If the connection URL is provided in the special DATABASE_URL environment
# variable, Rails will automatically merge its configuration values on top of
# the values provided in this file. Alternatively, you can specify a connection
# URL environment variable explicitly:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["MY_APP_DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
# Read https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-database
# for a full overview on how database URLs are structured.
#
# On Heroku and other platform providers, you may have a full connection URL
# available as an environment variable. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="mysql2://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# You can use this database configuration with:
#
#   production:
#     url: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"] %>
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: fishdb_production
  username: fishdb
  password: <%= ENV["FISHDB_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
